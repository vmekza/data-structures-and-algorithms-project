## Overview

This repository contains my final assignment for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences. It demonstrates the implementation of various search and sorting algorithms in Java.

## Features

- Search Algorithms: Linear and binary search.
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort (with randomized pivot), and merge sort.
- Performance Analysis: Compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms in terms of time and number of comparisons.
- Interactive Interface: Allows users to test different algorithms through a command-line menu.

## How to run

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Compile and run the Main.java file.
- Use the displayed menu to choose and test different search and sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms

- Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element of the array.
- Binary Search: Efficiently finds an item in a sorted array.
- Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- Quick Sort: Efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- Merge Sort: Efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

## Purpose

This project was created for educational purposes to understand and apply fundamental data structures and algorithms in software development.
